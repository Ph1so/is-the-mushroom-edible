### Classify Poisonous Mushrooms Machine Learning Project

# Overview

This repository contains a machine-learning project focused on predicting if a mushroom is poisonous using mushroom dimensions, shapes, and colors. 

# Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of over 54000 samples with 8 features, including cap dimensions, stem dimensions, color, and more. The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prishasawhney/mushroom-dataset?rvi=1).

# Approach

The steps involved in this project include:

- Importing data
- Understanding data: Understanding data distribution and correlation matrix.
- Model training: Training the selected algorithm on the preprocessed dataset.
- Model evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

# Results

Currently, the trained model achieved an accuracy score of 98%. 



# Usage

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Download files from this repo to access the dataset and Google Colab file
2. Upload the dataset and run the Google Colab to preprocess the data, train the model, make predictions, and evaluate.
   
# Technologies Used

Programming languages: `Python`

Libraries: `Scikit-learn` `Pandas` `NumPy` `Matplotlib` `Seaborn`

# Future Improvements

Some potential enhancements for this project include:
